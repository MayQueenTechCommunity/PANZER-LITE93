### MayQueen introduces PANZER-LITE93
Which is an edge fanless AIOT Computing based on NXP i.MX93 processor

Designed to bring out the full capabilities of the i.MX93 SoC, PANZER-LITE93 provides 2GB RAM and 32GB eMMC, 2 Gigabit Ethernet, RGMII, 1x USB 2.0 ports, 2 CANFD and 40 pin  header with raspberry PI compatible. Display connectivity is supported with HDMI. Measuring just 155 x 110 x 35 mm size with metal enclosure, PANZER-LITE93 also features wireless WiFi 802.11ac, Bluetooth 5.x, and IEEE802.15.4(Zigbee) functions. PANZER-LITE93 is offered with temperature range of 0C to 40C.

Excellent connectivity, low cost and small size make PANZER-LITE93 a modular solution for many applications such as AIOT Computing, IIoT gateway, robotic controller, and low power efficiency device. In addition, PANZER-LITE93 incorporates numerous design innovations on its 3D-printed plastic shell, such as easy disassembly and the addition of a dedicated shield for debugging/programming software. This feature allows you to perform development tasks without the need to dismantle the entire casing.

Software Support
PANZER-LITE93 is provided with a full BSP and ready-to-run images for the Linux operating system.
The PANZER-LITE93 BSP includes Linux kernel up to 6.6, Yocto/Ubuntu BSP and U-Boot boot-loader.

Because PANZER-LITE93 has a NPU inside the CPU, so we implementing AI functions for Linux OS such as TensorFlow-Lite, or OpenCV, etc..
